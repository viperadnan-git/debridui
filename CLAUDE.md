# Code Quality

- **No over-engineering**: Use the simplest solution that works. Avoid premature abstractions, unnecessary helpers, or complex patterns for simple problems
- **Follow linting rules**: Satisfy exhaustive-deps and other lint rules without using eslint-disable unless absolutely necessary
- **Clear comments**: Add comments only when logic isn't self-evident. Explain "why", not "what"
